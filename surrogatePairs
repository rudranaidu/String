Surrogage pairs: UTF-16 allows to encode upto 65,536 characters . If chracter falls beyond to this range then 
UTF-16 uses  scheme called  pairs of code units known as surrogates.
Java doesn't support UTF-32 so it comes up with approch called pair of 16 bit encoding to represent characters beyond 65536

Unicode has come up with a solution with pair of 2 - 16 bits to represent these characters. This solution implies the following:

16-bit high surrogates: 1,024 values (U+D800 to U+DBFF)
16-bit low surrogates: 1,024 values (U+DC00 to U+DFFF)

Example : Smiley symbols, Heart symbols etc

We can identify surrogate Pairs with method str.codePointCount(0,str.length()), which returns 1, even if the str length is 2

ie smiley symbols are represented using two 16 bit unicode characters.

if str.codePointCount(i, i+2) == 1 , then we can say that we found surrogate pairs.

public static List<Integer> extract(String str) {

  List<Integer> result = new ArrayList<>();

  for (int i = 0; i < str.length(); i++) {

    int cp = str.codePointAt(i);

    if (i < str.length()-1

        && str.codePointCount(i, i+2) == 1) {

      result.add(cp);

      result.add(str.codePointAt(i+1));

      i++;

    }

  }

  return result;

}
