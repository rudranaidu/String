Find the Celebrity: Suppose you are at a party with n people (labeled from 0 to n - 1) and among them, there may exist one celebrity.
A celebrity is defined as a person who knows no one but himself, but everyone else knows him. 
You need to find out the celebrity (if any) from a given list of people. 

knows = [
  [false, false, true, false],
  [false, false, true, false],
  [false, false, false, false],
  [false, false, true, false]
]

output is 2.

public class Main {
    public static int findCelebrity(int[][] knows) {
        int n = knows.length;
        int candidate = 0;

        // Find potential celebrity candidate
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            if (knows[candidate][i]) {
                candidate = i;
            }
        }

        // Verify if candidate is the celebrity
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (i != candidate && (knows[candidate][i] || !knows[i][candidate])) {
                // Candidate knows someone or someone doesn't know the candidate
                return -1; // No celebrity found
            }
        }

        return candidate; // Found the celebrity
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[][] knows = {
            {false, false, true, false},
            {false, false, true, false},
